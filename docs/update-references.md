Here’s a complete, polished documentation section you can add under your project as a technical and strategic justification for the **User History–based Preference Update system**. It’s framed as part of your architecture and also explains *why* it’s a good foundation, especially for new systems without enough ML data yet.

# 🧠 User History–Driven Preference Learning

This section explains the motivation, structure, and rationale behind our lightweight preference update engine based on user interaction history.

---

## 📌 Motivation

Building a recommendation system requires an understanding of user intent and evolving interests. While machine learning–based systems often excel at personalization, they require large datasets, long training cycles, and heavy infrastructure.

As our system is **new and rapidly evolving**, we designed a **rule-based, explainable, and scalable heuristic model** that can be used immediately — while still being extensible toward ML in the future.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

We track user interactions (likes, views, saves, dismisses, shares) across all content and convert them into updated user preferences — such as favorite tags, sources, and content types.

---

### 🔍 Tracked Actions

| Action   | Meaning                                | Weight |
|----------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| view     | User browsed or previewed the content  | +1     |
| like     | User liked or upvoted the content      | +3     |
| save     | User bookmarked the content            | +4     |
| share    | User shared it with others             | +2     |
| dismiss  | User explicitly disliked or skipped it | –5     |

Each action contributes a *weight* to the tags, source, and type associated with the content.

---

### 🧮 Preference Scoring Formulas

Let:
- \( H_u \) = user history for user \( u \)
- \( A \) = action (like, view, etc.)
- \( w_A \) = weight of action \( A \)
- \( T_c \), \( S_c \), \( Y_c \) = tags, source, and type of content \( c \)

#### 1. **Tag Preference Score**
\[
\text{TagScore}_u(t) = \sum_{(c, A) \in H_u \text{ where } t \in T_c} w_A
\]

#### 2. **Source Preference Score**
\[
\text{SourceScore}_u(s) = \sum_{(c, A) \in H_u \text{ where } S_c = s} w_A
\]

#### 3. **Content Type Preference Score**
\[
\text{TypeScore}_u(y) = \sum_{(c, A) \in H_u \text{ where } Y_c = y} w_A
\]

We then select the **top N** scoring items per category to form the user’s updated preferences.

## 📅 Preference Update Job (Scheduled)

This job runs on a **Vercel Cron Job (hourly)** and:

1. Fetches recent `UserHistory`.
2. Joins with `Content` to get tags, source, type.
3. Applies the formula above to compute updated scores.
4. Updates the `UserPreferences` table with:
   - Top tags → `interests`
   - Top sources → `sources`
   - Top content types → `contentTypes`
5. Invalidates the Redis cache for `/api/for-you` to ensure updates reflect immediately.

## ✅ Why This Is a Good Approach (Especially Early-Stage)

### ✅ Lightweight & Fast
- No need for training pipelines or GPU inference.
- Easy to understand, modify, and debug.
  
### ✅ Cold Start–Friendly
- Works even when a user has limited interaction data.
- Can bootstrap from a few actions (e.g., likes or dismissals).

### ✅ Scalable Toward ML
- This design logs everything needed for future modeling.
- Once enough data is collected, we can:
  - Learn embeddings from user behavior.
  - Train models to predict CTR or rank content.
  - Move from rule-based to learned scoring.

### ✅ Personalized Yet Transparent
- Developers and analysts can inspect why a piece of content was recommended.
- Useful for auditing, user trust, and content moderation.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Decay older actions over time (e.g., exponential decay).
- Use implicit signals (scroll depth, hover time).
- Hybridize with collaborative filtering for cross-user recommendations.
- Add an optional ML scoring pipeline using collected history.
